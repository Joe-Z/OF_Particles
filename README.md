###Information###
* There should be a GUI visible, but there seems to be some problem, so it's only visible if you
compile the program in debug-mode. I'm gonna try to fix it, as soon as I have time.
* The trackball-controls are entirely written by [egraether](https://github.com/egraether)
* This program was created with [OpenFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/) (V0.06) and
[MS Visual Studio 2008](http://www.microsoft.com/germany/visualstudio/products/default.aspx)
